This Project represents the implementation of basic restapi in spring

@Controller ---Used to Make our java class as mvc class
@ResponseBody ---Uses HTTP Message Converters to convert them return body to HTTP response body

@RestController is the Shorthand for @Controller+@ResponseBody

@Getmapping annotation is used to make the method as RESTapi

@Getmapping("/URL") ---to get the output in localhost

//GET HTTP METHOD

//http://localhost:8080/hello-world
